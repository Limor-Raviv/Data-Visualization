# Data-Visualization

## DataViz.Rmd :
This R markdown file contains the code you'll need for visuzalizing and analyzing your data.
It was originally part of the R-Ladies Nijmegen workshop series (https://twitter.com/RladiesNijmegen), and has been updated regularly since. 

The code includes 2 parts: 
- Data vizualization: examples + do-it-yourself exercises on how to create effective and beautiful plots using ggplot2, as well as some other neat packages
- Data analysis: runnning and interperting regression models using lme4 and the effects package

You'll learn how to present your raw data in different ways to make the best of your graphs, how to plot your summarized data, and how to visualize your regression models' results. There is also a quick refresher on how to use R Markdown.  

## DataViz.pdf and DataViz.docx:
These are the output files created by the code above. See how it looks! :)
